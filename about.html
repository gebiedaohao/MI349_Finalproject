                    In the history of more than 120 years of world automobile, British Automobile always
                    adheres to its traditional style, pursues noble and elegant modeling, pays attention
                    to the comfort of Royal riding, and has a persistent preference for excellent power
                    performance and sense of control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the technology core of Rover 75, Roewe, the first international brand of
                    China's automobile industry, created by the brand-new interpretation of British
                    quality gene and comprehensive integration of European luxury car technology, inherits
                    the classic British traditional style, elegance and gentlemanly taste, and persistently
                    adheres to the car making aesthetics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The core value of Roewe determines that Roewe Roewe is a new type of car designed
                    for social enterprising groups who pursue taste and connotation, advocate classics
                    and have innovative spirit, and achieve achievements in a self-confident and friendly
                    way. Therefore, whether Roewe 750 or new car 550, we can see things that come down
                    in one continuous line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gao Weimin, general manager of SAIC technology center, said in an exclusive interview
                    with the media that from the Rongwei 750 and Rongwei 550, which are now on the market,
                    we can see what is inherited. The basic feature of British cars with 100 years of
                    industrial experience is elegant shape, or "cigar type" body, which is also a classic
                    thing for Rongwei brand to inherit and follow. But on this basis, we have to extract
                    our own Roewe DNA according to the cultural characteristics and market demand of
                    China's automobile market.
